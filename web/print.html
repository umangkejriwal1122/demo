            Arthur Percy Sullivan VC (27 November 1896 â€“ 9 April 1937) was
            an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest 
            award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded
            to a member of the British Armed Forces. Born in South 
            Australia, Sullivan worked for the National Bank of 
            Australasia prior to enlisting in the Australian Imperial
            Force (AIF) in April 1918 for service in World War I. He 
            had arrived in the United Kingdom, but had not completed 
            training when the Armistice came into effect on 11 November.
            Sullivan was promoted to corporal in March 1919, but wanting to 
            see active service he sought and received his discharge from the 
            AIF on 28 May. On the same day he enlisted in the British Army 
            for service with the North Russia Relief Force, part of the 
            Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.
