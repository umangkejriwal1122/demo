            Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet 
            (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range 
            from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web 
            applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. 
            A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, 
            may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, 
            client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network 
            security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals,
            "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web 
            sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management 
            systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical 
            skills.
